Our goal is to fund the Jekyll Weekly newsletter via paid job listings. We feel that will provide benefit to all involved. But since we're just stared it doesn't seem fair to charge for this right now.

Based on other tech newsletters we anticipate to have thousands of developers on the list shortly. Most of them from the United States, but also some from the United Kingdom, Germany and other cool places. If this sounds interested to you, get in touch and let's talk. You can email us at newsletter@jekyllweekly.com.
