Our goal is to fund the Jekyll Weekly Newsletter via paid job listings. We feel that will provide benefit to all involved.

Most of our subscribers are from the United States, but also some from the United Kingdom, Germany and other cool places. If you'd like to get your job listing in front of JAMstack developers, get in touch and let's talk.

You can email us at newsletter@jekyllweekly.com.
