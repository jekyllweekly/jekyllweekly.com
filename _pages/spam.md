We have no interest in spam or unsolicited commercial e-mail. Unsubscribe links are at the bottom of every email and have immediate effect.

The newsletter's only advertising is from companies offering jobs. If one day we decided to take general advertisers we will not allow advertisers involved in mass unsolicited marketing campaigns or who have participated in such unsolicited e-mail schemes.

Our subscribers' e-mail addresses are stored securely by [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) and will not be sold or rented to third parties.

If you have questions or suggestions, please e-mail us at newsletter@jekyllweekly.com.
